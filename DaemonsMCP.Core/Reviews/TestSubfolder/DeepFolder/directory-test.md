# Directory Creation Test

**Test Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Test automatic directory creation during file creation

## Test Results

If you can read this file, then:

✅ **Deep directory creation works**
✅ **Path validation handles nested directories**  
✅ **File creation in new subdirectories functional**

## Directory Structure Created

This file should be located at:
`DaemonsMCP.Core/Reviews/TestSubfolder/DeepFolder/directory-test.md`

This tests the automatic directory creation functionality when `createDirectories=true`.
